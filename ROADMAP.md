# Archfiend Roadmap

The general goal of this project is to have a low-dependency, solid, pluggable Ruby daemon generator.

Ideas include
* exhaustive documentation for running (`bin/start`, `bin/console`) and development of generated daemons
* method to opt-out from any integrated gem
* removal of `config` dependency
* removal of `clockwork` dependency
* stand-alone generator option, to generate daemons with no external run time dependencies (with Archfiend base classes baked in)
